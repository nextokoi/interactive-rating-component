## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS Vanilla

### What I learned

I refreshed the Javascript I had and learned a way not to use a form to only use radio-type inputs, plus with Tailwind I discovered that with peer-checked I can use it so I can change the background of a label when it's selected.

```html
<input class="peer/first" type="radio" name="rating" id="first" value="1">
<label class="peer-checked/first:bg-orange peer-checked/first:text-white" for="first">1</label>
```

```js
let submit = document.getElementById('submit')
submit.addEventListener('click', () => {
    let elementActive = document.querySelector('input[name="rating"]:checked')
    if(elementActive) {
      alert(elementActive.value)
    } else {
        alert('Select a number')
    }
})
```

### Continued development

I'd like to learn React, but first I have to keep practicing with Javascript. I will continue with Tailwind for the time being, using some of the features that I have used and some that I will use in other projects and strengthen my knowledge of flexbox, grid, positioning and media queries.
